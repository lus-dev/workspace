/**
 * <p>Hash table and linked list implementation of the <tt>Map</tt> interface,
 * with predictable iteration order.  This implementation differs from
 * <tt>HashMap</tt> in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through
 * all of its entries.  This linked list defines the iteration ordering,
 * which is normally the order in which keys were inserted into the map
 * (<i>insertion-order</i>).  Note that insertion order is not affected
 * if a key is <i>re-inserted</i> into the map.  (A key <tt>k</tt> is
 * reinserted into a map <tt>m</tt> if <tt>m.put(k, v)</tt> is invoked when
 * <tt>m.containsKey(k)</tt> would return <tt>true</tt> immediately prior to
 * the invocation.)
 *
 * <p>This implementation spares its clients from the unspecified, generally
 * chaotic ordering provided by {@link HashMap} (and {@link Hashtable}),
 * without incurring the increased cost associated with {@link TreeMap}.  It
 * can be used to produce a copy of a map that has the same order as the
 * original, regardless of the original map's implementation:
 * <pre>
 *     void foo(Map m) {
 *         Map copy = new LinkedHashMap(m);
 *         ...
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * This technique is particularly useful if a module takes a map on input,
 * copies it, and later returns results whose order is determined by that of
 * the copy.  (Clients generally appreciate having things returned in the same
 * order they were presented.)
 *
 * <p>A special {@link #LinkedHashMap(int,float,boolean) constructor} is
 * provided to create a linked hash map whose order of iteration is the order
 * in which its entries were last accessed, from least-recently accessed to
 * most-recently (<i>access-order</i>).  This kind of map is well-suited to
 * building LRU caches.  Invoking the {@code put}, {@code putIfAbsent},
 * {@code get}, {@code getOrDefault}, {@code compute}, {@code computeIfAb
